# simple_dlib_face_detection  
# Face recognition by dlib  
**Dlib, OpenCV No installation required**  Builtable with Visual Studio 2012 C ++ (see example)  

With **simple_dlib_face_detection.dll** recognize the face by dlib.  
However, Visual Studio 2015 is required to rebuild **simple_dlib_face_detection.dll**.  
There is source code and project file for that in *dlib_dll*.  
The version of *dlib* you are using is 19.4.  To use the later version, you need to build it from dlib and place it in **dlib_build**.

**Note)**  

OpenCV can also be used.  In that case you need to install OpenCV.  

Exsample has a sample that does not use OpenCV and a sample that uses OpenCV.  

The version of OpenCV used in Exsample is 3.1. It is assumed that it is installed in **C:/dev/opencv-3.1.0**
